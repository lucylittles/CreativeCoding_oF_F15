#Project No. 2

-------

For my second project, I would like to start to integrate Open Frameworks with video.  I am going to attempt this in two way:

* I will be creating a series of textures, that I will attempt to integrate into the software Isadora via Syphon
* The textures will integrate changing states

*I will also be working to build an app that processes images and sound.


This lines sketch is the first texture I have made.
