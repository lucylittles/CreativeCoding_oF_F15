#OpenFrameworks final - Fall 15

-------

For my final project, I wanted to explore working with video and openFrameworks more deeply by creating a custom built video player.  I also wanted to work on integrating Of generated textures with the video signal.

My ultimate goal is to generate additional ways to process a video signal, but I ran out of time to make that happen. I was also having difficulty with some of the addons not running - I couldn't get Post Processing to run even with the examples.

* There are two files in the movie player (the files can be accessed [here] (https://drive.google.com/a/newschool.edu/folderview?id=0B-fjHiqqjTI0V0ltaVlKRFdmOGc&usp=sharing). They can be faded down with the alpha channel as well as tinted with the R, G, B sliders.

* The position and scale of the two video streams can also be modified.  Each video also has a Center lock button which brings the video back to the center and will lock the scale/position when it is enabled.

* There are two buttons at the bottom, one labelled "Lines" and the second labled "Static" these will enable two different textures that I previously created in Of.  The videos can be scalled out full screen to blend with these textures.

* I redrew the Static texture from where I had it at the midterm.  I am much happier with it now.


I used the ofxGui addon and actually gained a solid understanding of adding new sliders and buttons and connecting them to functionality within the video player.
