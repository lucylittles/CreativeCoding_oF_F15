#Project #1 Inspiration
Lauren Petty


-------

For my first project I am interested in exploring nature from Vinalhaven, an island off the coast of Maine that I go to every summer.

I am not exactly sure what I am interested in exploring - whether it is trees (various kinds of pines or birch), seaweed or wildflowers.

But, I am always strongly drawn to trees so I might just go that way.

I also threw on a screen grab from an old iphone app called iBonsai - that generates a variety of Bonsai trees.  I always loved this simple app and maybe want to use it as inspiration.
