##HW1 due (9/10 @ 6pm)

* Choose **at least** 10 sketches from within ```~/Desktop/openFrameworks/examples/``` that look interesting. Open them, and run them! Point here is to get a feel for the XCode/OF workflow and file structure.
* Create a github repo titled CreativeCoding_oF_F15_FirstName_LastName and submit the link as a comment to [the following issue](https://github.com/conorrussomanno/CreativeCoding_oF_F15/issues/1) of our main class repo. 
* Find a real-world phenomenon that is comprised of a hierarchy of parts (my example is the tree). This is what you will be working on for the duration of Part I of the semester, so make sure it's something you are passionally interested in procedurally generating over the course of a few weeks. Create a directory called **Project1_inspiration** in your personal repo, add images and a readme describing your project idea, then [push](http://guides.railsgirls.com/github/) your new content live. Examples might include:
	* A flower bed (pedal, flower, stem, flower garden)
	* An animal, or group of animals (maybe a fish bowl) ... (fin, fish, school)
	* A sky covered in clouds that are striking the ground with lightning (lightning segment, lightning bolt, cloud, storm)
	* You could also do a tree, and personalize it with flowers, and unique aesthetic features.
	* etc.
