#Tree Test - 2nd Attempt


-------

Ok - so I know this is super rudimentary but I am very psyched that I was able to make this on my own (almost...) - and actually understand what I am doing!

I know it's a bunch of lines on a page, but the fact that I got my vector to work (after two weeks of attempts...), that I was able to make the mouse release work, and actually change the color - is HUGE for me.

I am not sure why the rotation is not happening around a central access but I will figure that out soon...and then I will tackle recursion...


#####UPDATE 10.7.15:

Regina and I worked on this today - and we added some more bells and whisltes.  I learned how to make backgrounds and we changed the rotation.
