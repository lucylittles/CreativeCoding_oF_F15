#Tree Test - 1st Attempt


-------

Argh! - openFrameworks!!!

Once again, I am back to very basic drawing - I want to see how much I can generate on my own.  All I want to do is make a vector of circles - but it does not work!

Regina was initially stumped during office hours, but figured it out - but now her fix does not work either...so I am starting over again because maybe there is some type I missed.
